‘Speak Faster Observer’ is a data collection app for the Speak Faster research effort.

This app will be developed for Windows based AAC devices, with phase 1 constrained to observing and
collection the use of Balabolka on a Surface Pro computer with a Tobii PC Eye 5 and Tobii Windows Control.

It will collect computer usage data including intercepting keyboard and mouse events, collecting screen and camera captures.

The app will include a “recording on” notification in the Windows System Tray and a simple Toggle On/Off button for recording.


The captured data will be stored in local disk storage on the Surface Pro using common data formats such as JPG/PNG (image)
and JSON (data) files, to be uploaded at a later date by a Google Cloud uploading agent provided by a different application.

The phase 1 app will not include collection of eye gaze data or contextual data.  The goal of Phase 1 is to collect enough
data to reliably measure the WPM output of generating speech using a combination of Tobii Computer Control and Balabolka by
observing the computer screen and Windows Events.
